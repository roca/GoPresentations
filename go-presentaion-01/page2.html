	<br>
    		<p>
			The TIOBE Programming Community index is an indicator of the popularity of programming languages.
			The index is updated once a month. The ratings are based on the number of skilled engineers world-wide, 
			courses and third party vendors. Popular search engines such as <strong>Google</strong>, Bing, Yahoo!, Wikipedia, <strong>Amazon</strong>, 
			YouTube and Baidu are used to calculate the ratings. 
			<br><br>
			It is important to note that the TIOBE index is <strong>not</strong> about the best programming language or the language 
			in which most lines of code have been written.
			<br><br>
			The index can be used to check whether your programming skills are still up to date or 
			to make a strategic decision about what programming language should be adopted when starting 
			to build a new software system.
