* Hello, world 2.0

* Not so new (developed by Google in 2007)
It is designed to be simple, efficient, and easy to learn, and it has gained popularity in recent years for its ability to handle concurrent and networked systems. Go's popularity has been growing in the past years, it's been widely adopted by companies like Uber, Soundcloud, Dropbox and many more for building their infrastructure. It is also well suited for building microservices, which are increasingly popular in cloud-based architectures. It is also used for building CLI tools, utilities, and other lightweight applications. I believe that Go will continue to see increased usage in the next 10 years, especially in the field of cloud-native and microservices development.

* Why invent a new language? 
- Older languages weren't designed for todays modern hardware, but modern software needs it:
- We are now in a age of large scale, networked, multi-core computing

* The problem: Older languages are frustrating on a day-to-day basis

* The solution
- Go has the lighter feel of a scripting language but is compiled
