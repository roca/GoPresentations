			It is designed to be simple, efficient, and easy to learn, and it has gained popularity 
			in recent years for its ability to handle concurrent and networked systems. 
			Go's popularity has been growing in the past years, it's been widely adopted by 
			companies like Uber, Soundcloud, Dropbox and many more for building their infrastructure.
			It is also well suited for building microservices, which are increasingly popular in 
			cloud-based architectures. It is also used for building CLI tools, utilities, 
			and other lightweight applications. I believe that Go will continue to see increased 
			usage in the next 10 years, especially in the field of cloud-native and microservices 
			development.
