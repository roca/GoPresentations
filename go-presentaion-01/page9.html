		Go has the lighter feel of a scripting language but is compiled.
		All the features of Go contribute to its primary benefit.
	</p
	-->
	<ul style="font-size:20px">
		<li><strong>Static typing</strong> provides a type system that ensures conversions and compatibility while avoiding issues that come with dynamically typed languages.
		<strong>Runtime errors are caught statically</strong>
		</li>
		<li>Support for <strong>testing</strong> includes unit tests that run in parallel with written code and allow for debugging and quality assurance.</li>
		<li>Platform independence takes advantage of Go's modular design to let its code be compiled on almost any platform. With <strong>zero dependencies.</strong>
		("aix", "android", "darwin", "dragonfly", "freebsd", "hurd", "illumos", "ios", "js", "linux", "nacl", "netbsd", "openbsd", "plan9", "solaris", "windows", "zos")
		</li>
		<li><strong>Go does not need any virtual machine</strong>. It directly compiles the code into binary code before executing the program.</li>
		<li>
			A <strong>concurrency</strong> model is based on lightweight <strong>goroutines</strong> that behave like threads and a <strong>channel</strong> mechanism that facilitates communication between goroutines. 
			The code's syntax mimics the fundamental patterns commonly used in dynamic languages and favors composition <strong>interfaces over inheritance</strong>. 
			This enables developers to write programs that can perform multiple tasks at once.
		</li>
		<li>Go has a great <strong>standard library</strong>, including a <strong>JSON</strong> parser, <strong>HTTP</strong> client, its on <strong>testing</strong> framing and more.</li>
