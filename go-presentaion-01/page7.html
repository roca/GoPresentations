		Go has the lighter feel of a scripting language but is compiled.
		All the features of Go contribute to its primary benefit.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A standard library is based on the use of distributed packages and makes it easy to add and use additional functionality in code.</li>
		<li>Code package management allows for the management of user-created and external code packages, and enables publishing packages using a small set of commands.</li>
		<li>Static typing provides a type system that ensures conversions and compatibility while avoiding issues that come with dynamically typed languages.</li>
		<li>Support for testing includes unit tests that run in parallel with written code and allow for debugging and quality assurance.</li>
		<li>Platform independence takes advantage of Go's modular design to let its code be compiled on almost any platform.</li>
		<li>A concurrency model is based on lightweight goroutines that behave like threads and a channel mechanism that facilitates communication between goroutines. The code's syntax mimics the fundamental patterns commonly used in dynamic languages and favors composition interfaces over inheritance. This enables developers to write programs that can perform multiple tasks at once.</li>
	</ul>
